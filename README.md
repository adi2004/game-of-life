Game of Life
============

Welcome to rookie my implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

Currently in progress... just so I would get used to Swift.

This seems to be a good example of a demo app to make in order to learn something. It's been done many times and there are plenty of available apps and implementations available. So it's good to see how the others made the UI and also in some cases have access to the code.
